# This virtual server allows EAP-TLS to reject access requests
# based on some attributes of the certificates involved.
#
# To use this virtual server, you must enable it in the tls
# section of mods-enabled/eap as well as adding a link to this
# file in sites-enabled/.
#
#
# Value-pairs that are available for checking include:
#
#   TLS-Client-Cert-Subject
#   TLS-Client-Cert-Issuer
#   TLS-Client-Cert-Common-Name
#   TLS-Client-Cert-Subject-Alt-Name-Email
#
# To see a full list of attributes, run the server in debug mode
# with this virtual server configured, and look at the attributes
# passed in to this virtual server.
#
#
# This virtual server is also useful when using EAP-TLS as it is
# only called once, just before the final Accept is about to be
# returned from eap, whereas the outer authorize section is called
# multiple times for each challenge / response. For this reason,
# here may be a good location to put authentication logging, and
# modules that check for further authorization, especially if they
# hit external services such as sql or ldap.


server kafka-delivery-report {


# Authorize - this is the only section required.
#
# To accept the access request, set Auth-Type = Accept, otherwise
# set it to Reject.
